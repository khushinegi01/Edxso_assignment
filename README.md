#  Matrix Click Game - React.js + Tailwind CSS

## 📝 Overview
A simple 3x3 matrix game where clicking a box **changes it to green**, and once all boxes are clicked, **they turn orange sequentially** in the order they were clicked.

##  Features
✔️ **Interactive Clickable Buttons**  
✔️ **Color Changes on Click (Green  → Orange )**  
✔️ **Smooth Animation with Delays**  
✔️ **Optimized using React's `useState` and `useEffect`**  
✔️ **Styled using Tailwind CSS** 


## 🎯 Why This Approach is Optimal?

✔️ **`useState`** keeps UI fast and reactive.  
✔️ **`useEffect`** efficiently triggers animations only when needed.  
✔️ **Component Reusability (`Button.jsx`)** keeps the code clean and modular.  
✔️ **Tailwind CSS** avoids the need for extra CSS files.  
✔️ **Minimal re-renders**, making it performant.
